Additional published cases using AMR-Wind
=========================================

These simulations have been performed for verification and validation of this CFD tool.
Following publication of the methods paper on AMR-Wind, this page will provide those cases
to the public, though these are not intended as benchmark cases in the same manner as the
rest of this repository. For now, while the paper is under review, we provide the input
files only.
